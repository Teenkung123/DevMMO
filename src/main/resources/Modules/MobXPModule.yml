  # A mathematical expression for the base XP.
  # We'll do something like "30 + (0.4 * ({level} ^ 2.25))"
  # to emulate your original formula. But you can change it freely.
  BaseFormula: "30 + (0.4 * ({level} ^ 2.25))"

  # The portion that modifies XP by the player's additional XP stat, if any.
  # e.g. finalXP = baseXP + (baseXP * {additionalXp}/100).
  # If you'd like direct formula control, we could do something more advanced,
  # but let's keep it simpler here.
